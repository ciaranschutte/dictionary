## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How do I submit multiple values for a field? For example, I want to submit multiple symptoms for the `presenting_symptoms` field.

   To include multiple values, separate values with a pipe delimiter '|' within your file. For example: `Anemia|Fatigue|Fever`.

2. Is there any resource to refer to in order to follow staging guidelines?

    Please refer to the guidelines provides by the [AJCC Cancer Staging](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx) website. Other helpful resources include the [CAnswer Forum](http://cancerbulletin.facs.org/forums/).

3. The `tumour_staging_system` field does not contain the staging system I use. Can we request the staging system be added?

    Yes, if the tumour staging system or tumour grading system you use is not included in the controlled terminology for `tumour_staging_system` or `tumour_grading_system`, please [contact us](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/contact) to request it be added.
